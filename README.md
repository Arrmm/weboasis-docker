This is just a docker compose configuration leveraging the great work from https://github.com/ParrotDevelopers/WebOasis.

I have included the dockerfile in case anyone wants to build it themselves.

Disclaimer: I take absolutely zero credit for the hard work that many awesome people have put it.  I am just another fan of WebOasis, and I want to embrace and spread the greatness.
